                        <p>Pre-engineered buildings (PEBs) are a type of building that is designed and manufactured in a factory, and then transported to the site for assembly. They are typically made up of steel components, and are often used for industrial and commercial purposes.</p>
                        <br />
                        <p>PEBs have a number of advantages over other types of buildings, including:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>  &#x25C9;&nbsp; They are quick and easy to erect, which can save time and money on construction costs.
                            </li>
                            <li> &#x25C9;&nbsp; They are strong and durable, and can withstand harsh weather conditions.</li>
                            <li>  &#x25C9;&nbsp; They are flexible and can be easily expanded or modified as needed.</li>
                            <li>  &#x25C9;&nbsp; They are environmentally friendly, as they can be recycled at the end of their life.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <br />
                        <p>PEBs are commonly used for a variety of industrial purposes, including:</p>

                        <p>Warehouses, Factories, Distribution centers, Manufacturing plants, Aircraft hangars, Sports stadiums.</p>

                        <p>PEBs are also increasingly being used for commercial purposes, such as:</p>
                        <p>Retail stores, Office buildings, Hotels, Schools, Hospitals.</p>
                        <p>PEBs are a versatile and cost-effective option for a wide range of building needs. They are strong, durable, and easy to erect, making them a popular choice for both industrial and commercial applications.</p>

                        <p style={{ fontWeight: "bold" }}>PEBs can be made with a combination of:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>&#x25C9;&nbsp; Built-up sections</li>

                            <li>&#x25C9;&nbsp; Cold formed elements</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p style={{ fontWeight: "bold" }}>For roofing and wall cladding, PEBs can have:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>&#x25C9;&nbsp; Single skin sheeting with added insulation</li>
                            <li>&#x25C9;&nbsp; Insulated sandwich panels</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p style={{ fontWeight: "bold" }}>Some advantages of PEBs include:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>&#x25C9;&nbsp; Erection cost: Easy connections reduce on-site erection costs</li>
                            <li>&#x25C9;&nbsp; Transportation cost: Secondary members and cladding nest together</li>
                            <li>&#x25C9;&nbsp; Expansion: Buildings can be expanded in length, width, and height</li>
